## About the app:
**Stadium App** is a dynamic booking tool designed for sports enthusiasts, offering a range of services from stadium bookings to match ticket purchases across various sports. To ensure a secure and exclusive user experience, it mandates authentication either through Google OAuth for quick access or via JWT for traditional sign-in.
The app serves diverse user roles:
- **Customers**: who can easily book match tickets,
- **Enterprise**: with the facility to book stadiums and organize matches, and
- **Administrators**: who oversee enterprise account approvals. Additionally, admins have the authority to add new stadiums to the app.
